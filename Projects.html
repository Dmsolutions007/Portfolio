    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div><h3>Cloud Infrastructure Deployment</h3><p>Designed and deployed scalable AWS cloud infrastructure using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.</p></div>
    <div><h3>I deployed a multi-tier WordPress service using Terraform</h3><p>This involved creating a VPC with public and private subnets. 
        An RDS instance and an EC2 instances were deployed in the private subnets to prevent direct access from the wider internet. 
        I installed and configured the LAMP stack and WordPress on the EC2 instance. 
        I then configured an ALB in the public subnets so that I could route requested traffic from the internet to my private WordPress service.
        Connection between all these services were controlled using security groups with least permissive access in mind. All these resources were created using a Terraform script I wrote.
        .</p></div>
    <div><h3>E-commerce Product Landing Page</h3><p>Built a sleek, responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with integrated animations and transitions.</p></div>
    <div><h3>DevOps Dashboard</h3><p>Created a real-time monitoring dashboard using Grafana and Prometheus for system metrics and alerting.</p></div>
    <div><h3>CI/CD Pipeline Automation</h3><p>Implemented automated pipelines with GitHub Actions and integrated Docker for seamless deployment workflows.</p></div>
    <div><h3>Multi-Cloud Management Tool</h3><p>Built a dashboard to manage resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP using APIs and modern frontend technologies.</p></div>
    <div><h3>I created an autoscaling EC2 infrastructure to ensure that an Apache web service was self-healing and scalable. </h3><p>This involved configuring Launch templates, UserData scripts, ALB, Target Groups and CloudWatch Alarms to ensure scale-out and scale-in activities based on CPU metrics.
    </p></div>
    <div><h3>Monitoring and Alerting System</h3><p>Developed a full-stack monitoring system with alert triggers for server downtime using Node.js and Prometheus.</p></div>
